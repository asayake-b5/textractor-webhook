* Server for Textractor-Webhook
** How To Use
1. Download the release here
2. Run it
   - You can use the argument -b (or --bind) to change the binding address, useful if you
   - By default, will bind to 127.0.0.1:8000 (or the first port available after that)
3. Modify the webhook_url.txt file appropriately
   e.g. (change the url of course)
   #+begin_example
192.168.1.25:8000
/api/push
   #+end_example
4. Head to that url, as textractor processes more lines it'll be updated automagically!

** Compiling
#+begin_example
git clone placeholder
cd placeholder/server
cargo build --release
#+end_example
And then the file is in target/release/server
